MODs

A mod is just a folder placed into the "mod" directory.
the name of the directory, is also the name for the mod. (so no special characters!)
the directory must obey a certain structure to be loaded properly.

    script/
    gfx/
    sounds/






Example: Zombie mod

structure:
zombie/data/scripts/zombie/zombie.lua
zombie/data/gfx/zombie/zombie.png
zombie/data/sounds/zombie/select.ogg

This directory must be copied to
AlphaDirectory/mods/

The mods are loaded on startup.
(MAYBE???: scripts can be changed during the game.)
